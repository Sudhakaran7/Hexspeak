A decimal number can be converted to its Hexspeak representation by first converting it to an uppercase hexadecimal string, then replacing 
all occurrences of the digit 0 with the letter O, and the digit 1 with the letter I.  Such a representation is valid if and only if it 
consists only of the letters in the set {"A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "I", "O"}.
Given a string num representing a decimal integer N, return the Hexspeak representation of N if it is valid, otherwise return "ERROR".

Input Description:

Output Description:
Print the Hexspeak representation of N if it is valid, otherwise return "ERROR".
